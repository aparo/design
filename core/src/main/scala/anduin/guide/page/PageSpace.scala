          |# Usage Notes
          |
          |**Distance reflects relationship,** so smaller step implies closer
          |connection and vice versa. For example, the margins between
          |elements inside a card are often smaller than the margin between
          |cards themselves.
          |
          |**The smallest space is currently 4 pixel,** so if you need
          |something smaller, consider using Border or Color for separating
          |things instead. Currently there is no plan to add space that is
          |smaller than 4 pixel.
          |
          |**In the other hand, the largest space is 32 pixel,** so if you
          |need something bigger, consider using relative position (such as
          |centering it and then optionally offset), or inline the style
          |(such as `^.margin := 56px`).
          |
          |>::warning::**Under consideration: Support for larger than 24 pixels**
          |>
          |>The current scale focuses more on small spaces to fine-tune
          |>details, therefore it stops at 32 pixel.
          |>
          |>However, this makes it's difficult to have wide, spacious spacing
          |>at app-level (i.e: margin between areas of main layout). Therefore,
          |>we are considering to add more values after 32: 40 48 56 and 64
          |>pixel (8-pixel scale).
